# 🚀 ETech Controller

This module is designed to power an educational platform with a dual-persona AI: a specialized **Subject Tutor ("Edu_X")** and a human-mimicking **Administrative Assistant**.

### 🎭 Dynamic Personas
The system dynamically injects system instructions based on context:
* **Edu_X (The Tutor):** High-energy, emoji-friendly teaching persona. Supports specific subject constraints (Technology Stream), stress-detection protocols (jokes/motivation), and Socratic teaching methods.
* **Admin (The Human):** Mimics a busy Sri Lankan support agent. Features "Night Mode" (time-aware responses), strict short-text formatting, and direct database verification for payments/IDs.

### 🇱🇰 Localization & Context
* **Language Support:** Native handling of English and Sinhala (Unicode).
* **Cultural Context:** Built-in logic for Sri Lankan exams (A/L), local payment methods, and youth slang/Singlish parsing.

### 🛠️ Advanced Capabilities
* **Tool Use:** Integrated Google Search for finding educational videos (Tutor mode only).
* **Memory Management:** Automatic history trimming to maintain context window efficiency.
* **Stream Stability:** Robust error handling for streaming responses.
